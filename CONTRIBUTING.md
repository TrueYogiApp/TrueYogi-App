## Note on Backend Features

This repository does **not** include the backend server file.  
Features such as wallet authentication, token claiming, and syncing require our hosted backend API.

- For most frontend contributions, you can run and test the meditation app without the backend.

If you clone and run this code locally, wallet-based features will not work unless you have access to our backend.

Thank you for understanding!
